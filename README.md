## Installation

Run npm i in a terminal integrated with the project root file to install the necessary packages, then run npm start to fire up the server. You'll have to set up the routes in a testing program of your choice (I used Insomnia) at the endpoints specified in the user-routes and thought-routes files in the routes/api/ directory in order to try them out.

## Usage

This can be used as a starting backend for a social media platform. It's just waiting for a frontend to connect to it!
